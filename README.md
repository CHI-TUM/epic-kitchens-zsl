# Towards Audio-based Zero-Shot Action Recognition in Kitchen Environments

This repository accompanies the paper
"Towards Audio-based Zero-Shot Action Recognition in Kitchen Environments" of (Gebhard et al., 2025). 

## Status
---

**WARNING:** This repository is still under construction. We are now in the process of cleaning up and adding instructions.

## Using the repository
---

We will add detailed instructions on how to use each part of the repository shortly.

##  Code structure
---
Our repository comprises three main folders:

1. `src` contains the main code to train the model.
2. `processing` contains the scripts to process audio data and extract embeddings.
3. `analysis` contains scripts for some analyses.

## Dataset
---
This code builds on the Epic-Kitchens-55 [1] and Epic-Kitchens-100 [2] dataset.
